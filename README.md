# 🎓 End-to-End Online Course Completion Prediction using Machine Learning, FastAPI & OOP  

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end machine learning workflow** — from data preprocessing and model building to **deployment using FastAPI**.  
It predicts whether a student will complete an online course based on demographic and device usage patterns, following clean **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and modern API development standards.
